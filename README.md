## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an online event created by Eric Wastl, where participants solve programming puzzles related to various concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and mathematics. Each day, a new set of challenges is released, and participants compete to solve them as quickly as possible.

To learn more about Advent of Code, visit [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).
Feel free to explore the solutions for each day to see how the challenges were approached.
